<!-- This is a placeholder for favicon.ico -->
<!-- Since we can't create binary files directly, you'll need to: -->
<!-- 1. Create a 16x16 or 32x32 pixel icon image -->
<!-- 2. Convert it to .ico format using an online converter -->
<!-- 3. Save it as favicon.ico in the root directory -->

<!-- For now, let's add a proper favicon link in the HTML -->
